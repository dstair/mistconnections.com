This contains instructions for running the Mist Connections app on the CS50 appliance.
It uses the "PSet 8" server style, in which a user access content served on the
appliance from their native OS.

The folder "mist" should be placed in the ~/vhosts/localhost/public/ folder,
assuming that this folder is set up the same way it was for PSet 8.


To set permissions within the folder, in a terminal window execute:

cd ~/vhosts/localhost/public/mist
find . -type d | xargs chmod 711
find . -type f | xargs chmod 644


Then set directory permissions in the same way that PSet 8 did, again from a
terminal window:

chmod 711 ~
chmod 711 ~/vhosts
chmod 711 ~/vhosts/localhost
chmod 711 ~/vhosts/localhost/public
chmod 711 ~/vhosts/localhost/public/mist

Accessing [IP]/mist from a browser in your native OS (for testing, Chrome
running on an OS 10.8 machine was used). You should be ready to start using
Mist. Enjoy!
